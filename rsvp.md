This is an article that summarizes my team's experience in when we were creating our Umoja3 project  for the hackathon.

We created an event rsvp ticketing dapp, that allows users to purchase rsvp tickets in any event. Whereby  if the users are present in the event they get refunded for their expenses when purchasing the ticket but if they are not present in the event they do not get their refunds cause they did not appear at the event.

When the hack started we to battle the  rock paper scissor tutorial, which was just the beginning of the challanege, it was lengthy  and a bit difficult to ubderstand  but we were able to scale through.


Fast forward to our project, we did not know where  to start, we just had ideas and we didnt really understand  how to make those ideas reality, after the first few weeks of research of the documentations, github resources, previous projects and learning via the weekly challanges I was able to begin my index.rsh file and I slowly but gradually started getting the major funtionalities down.

First time I had problems was with interacting with  my frontend  and my mentor helped me out with a link to the wisdom for sale video which helped me understand how to integrate my backend into my frontend. I also got some help from the community with a react boilerplate which made the whole process seamless for me and my teammate.

The most challenging obstacle  I experienced was using the API, it was so confusing but after the API challenge and extra research I got a hang of it.

One thing I love about reach is the theorem validation and the mindblowing features of the compiler, most importantly how my index.rsh file is been converted to a lengthier and well defined `main.index.mjs` file that interacts with the frontend, I also enjoyed creating the console app and I was really glad when i figured out how to manipulate that to get the outcome I desired.

If I had a chance to redevelop my project I would create a bigger ticketing system where users  can purchase tickets and also set up event tickets for sale too making a platform like amazon that connects  sellers to buyers but instead event organizers to their expected audience.

I would like to thank my teammate, my mentor  and the reach community for giving us this opportunity to add values to ourselves and also secure opportunites in the future. Thank You All.
